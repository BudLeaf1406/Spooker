IF YOU CAN'T COMPLETE IT AND YOU WAN'T TO KILL PERSISTENCE:
try to close the program ATLEAST ONCE!
open cmd
write this command:
taskkill /im "prankxd.exe" /f

A cool little scary program for halloween(100% late).

Basic its this:

You open the program.

Its all red and spooooky!

Then it gives you some jigsaw text and tells you about the game!

The game just gives you completly random math questions.

If you get it wrong 3 times well....

lets say it will annoy well.

Complete it and it will tell you how to kill it.

BTW:

Persistence:)
